<h1>ROS interface</h1>

<p>The ROS interface is part of the <a href="apisOverview.htm">V-REP API framework</a>.</p>

<p>ROS is a distributed pseudo operating system allowing for easy management and communication between multiple computers connected in a network. Please refer to the <a href="http://www.ros.org">official ROS documentation</a> for details about ROS.</p>

<p>V-REP can act as a ROS node that other nodes can communicate with in following 3 ways:</p>

<li><strong>The V-REP node offers ROS services</strong>. <a href="rosFunctionListAlphabetical.htm">V-REP ROS services</a> are available as soon as V-REP is launched (given that roscore is running and the ROS plugin to V-REP was correctly loaded).</li>
<li><strong>V-REP can be enabled to advertise topics, and publish data to them</strong>. <a href="rosPublishers.htm">V-REP ROS publishers</a> can only be enabled and are only operational while a simulation is running. One exception to this is the <a href="rosPublisherTypes.htm#simros_strmcmd_get_info"><em>info</em> topic</a>: data to that topic will be streamed as long as V-REP is running.</li>
<li><strong>V-REP can be enabled to subscribe to topics, read  data from them, and apply the data to specific objects/items inside V-REP</strong>. <a href="rosSubscribers.htm">V-REP ROS subscribers</a> can only be enabled and are only operational while a simulation is running.</li>

<p>The ROS functionality in V-REP is enabled via a plugin: <em>libv_repExtROS.so</em> or <em>libv_repExtROS.dylib</em>. The code to the plugin is open source and is located in the <em>programming/ros_stacks</em> folder. The plugin can easily be adapted to your own needs. The plugin is loaded when V-REP is launched, but the load operation will only be successful if roscore was running at that time. Make sure to inspect V-REP's console window or terminal for details on plugin load operations.</p>
