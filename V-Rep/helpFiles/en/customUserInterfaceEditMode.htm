<h1>Custom user interface edit mode</h1>

<p>The custom user interface edit mode can be activated with [Menu bar --&gt; Edit --&gt; Edit Modes --&gt; Enter user interface Edit Mode]. An alternative way of entering and leaving the custom user interface edit mode is by clicking the following toolbar button:</p>

<br>


<p>Make sure the simulation is stopped. In the custom user interface edit mode, the <a href="userInterface.htm#SceneHierarchy">scene hierarchy view</a> is used to display the various custom user interfaces in the <a href="scenes.htm">scene</a> as a list. Items in the list can be selected with the mouse, however only one at a time. Following figure illustrates the custom user interface edit mode:<br>
</p>

<p class=imageLabel>[Custom user interface edit mode]</p>
<br>

<p>Copy/paste/delete/cut operations on custom user interfaces in the list are supported with the regular key combination (i.e. ctrl-c, ctrl-v, delete and ctrl-x). The same copy/paste/delete/cut functionalities can also be accessed through the popup-menu or through [Menu bar --&gt; Edit]. <br>
</p>

<p>A custom user interface is constituted by cells forming a rectangular surface. The number of cell-rows and cell-columns can be defined in the custom user interface dialog. Following figure displays a custom user interface as seen normally, and its corresponding display when in edit mode:
</p>

<p align=center><img src="images/customUserInterfaceEditMode2.jpg"></p>
<p class=imageLabel>[Two corresponding custom user interfaces, (1) normal display, (2) edit mode display]</p>
<br>


<p>From above figure it can be seen that cells can be left empty and won't display in the normal mode (non edit mode). In the edit mode, all cells are shown with an orange frame. Cells can be merged to form bigger cells, but in that case they are not allowed to be empty anymore. Single cells or merged cells are however always rectangular. Individual cells are selected by clicking them (the cell's orange frame will turn white or yellow to indicate the selection state). Holding down the ctrl-key during selection allows for multiple selection of cells belonging to a same custom user interface. The last selected cell is indicated with a white frame, other selected cells are indicated with a yellow frame. Holding down the shift-key during selection allows selecting a rectangular surface of cells. The custom user interface dialog is context sensitive and will display a different content according to the cell's selection state.<br>
